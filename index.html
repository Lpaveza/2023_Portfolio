                    <p>I'm a 16 year old, who's currently pursuing an interest in graphic design and coding, following in the foot steps of my parents. </p>
                    <p> I have interests currently in writing, dog training, and (?). With a pursuit of these interests in school currently, I'm hoping to make a career out of dog training. <br> </p>
                    <p>I also volunteer at my local American Kennel Club equivalent, as I'm being taught how to properly judge dog shows. I also have multiple awards involving my writing, with a 3rd place in a fire safety writing contest. </p>
                    <p>In the sections below, I have examples of my digital art work along with assigned writing prompts</p>

It used to cause me great sorrow and grief; I missed home, but now it reminds me that while I cannot return, this piece of life gives me producing happiness throughout the time I spend on this plane. Flora and fauna around me follow the sun’s cycle; I don’t rely on it to gain energy, instead running like a machine with power from other preserved sources.</p>

Annie woke up the morning of Friday the 13th, unknowing of the date, and so she went about it as if it were any other day, packing her backpack and going to the bus stop. This is where things begin to go wrong, as the bus never arrives. It had broken down that morning, never leaving the bus lot.</p>

This prevented them from experiencing a lot of things they dreamed of doing. Today was when Frederick finally achieved something they’d wanted to do since entering adolescence: going on a date. This leads us to today, where Frederick is overwhelmed with thoughts and options, not aware of the things that might occur, but at the same time, unable to show these emotions. Their childhood left them angry at life for its cruelness, as it took everything from them, leaving them a lone orphan in this dark world. </p>
